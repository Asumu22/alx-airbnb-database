# Task 0 - Complex Queries with Joins

This task demonstrates how to use different types of SQL joins in the Airbnb-like database.

### Objectives
- Write SQL queries using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
- Show how data can be combined across multiple tables.

### Queries Implemented
1. **INNER JOIN**: Retrieve all bookings along with the associated user details.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieve all properties with their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieve all users and their bookings, ensuring unmatched users and bookings are also included.

### Files
- [`joins_queries.sql`](./joins_queries.sql): Contains all the SQL queries for this task.
