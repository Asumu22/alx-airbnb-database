# Airbnb Database - Sample Data Seed

This folder contains the SQL script to populate the Airbnb database with realistic sample data for testing and development purposes.

## Purpose

The `seed.sql` script inserts initial records into the database tables, simulating real-world scenarios. This allows developers to:

- Test queries and application functionality with realistic data
- Visualize relationships between entities such as Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, and Messages
- Ensure data integrity and constraints are working correctly

## Tables Seeded

- **User**: Guests, hosts, and admin accounts
- **Property**: Sample properties linked to hosts
- **Booking**: Bookings made by users for properties
- **Payment**: Payments associated with bookings
- **Review**: User reviews on properties
- **Message**: Messages exchanged between users
